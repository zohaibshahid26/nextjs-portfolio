Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to build custom
designs. This post will introduce you to the basics of Tailwind CSS.

## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility
classes to build custom designs without writing custom CSS. It allows you to
create responsive and modern designs quickly and efficiently.

```jsx
export default function Example() {
  return <div className='bg-blue-500 p-4 text-white'>Hello, Tailwind CSS!</div>
}
```

## Why use Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a great choice for building custom designs because it provides a
number of features that make it easy to create responsive and modern designs.
Some of the key features of Tailwind CSS include:

- **Utility-First**: Tailwind CSS provides low-level utility classes that can be
  composed to build custom designs.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS makes it easy to create responsive designs
  with its built-in responsive utilities.

## How to use Tailwind CSS

it in your project. Here is an example of how to set up Tailwind CSS in a
Next.js project:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Then, configure your `tailwind.config.js` to include your project's paths:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {}
  },
  plugins: []
}
```

You can then start using Tailwind CSS classes in your components:

```jsx
export default function Example() {
  return <div className='bg-blue-500 p-4 text-white'>Hello, Tailwind CSS!</div>
}
```
